    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Cera Brasileira is more than just a product – it’s a tradition.  
      Our recipe has been passed down through generations in Brazil since 1992, 
      carefully crafted with <strong>natural honey and propolis</strong> 
      to provide smooth, effective, and gentle hair removal.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe beauty should be simple, natural, and safe. That’s why our wax 
      is <strong>free from harsh chemicals, preservatives, and artificial colors</strong>, 
      making it suitable for both women and men, and safe even for 
      <strong>pregnant and breastfeeding mothers</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, Cera Brasileira continues to uphold the same values: authenticity, 
      quality, and respect for nature. With every pack, we deliver the essence 
      of Brazil’s timeless beauty tradition.
